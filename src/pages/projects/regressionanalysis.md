In 2023 I've started a class about Inference and Regression Analyisis, where I learned a lot about statistics and data science, Fisher information and the basics of regression, hypothesis tests and confidence interval metrics, as well as R and the tidyverse package.

For my final project, I used the AutoMPG dataset, created by Statlib, trying to give an answer to "Can you predict the fuel efficiency of a car?".
