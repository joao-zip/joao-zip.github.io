  <img src="/me.jpg" alt="My not so beauty face">

  <p>I'm João Pedro, a brazilian computer science student at UNIFESP(Federal University of São Paulo). I enjoy music, read philosophy and theology books, as well as learn new languages and do some dog training with my, well, my dog. Python and C++ are the programming languages that I use in my day-to-day work, mainly for coding university assignments, CLI's for my personal use and some crazy projects that came to my mind sometimes.</p>
  <p>In the moment, I'm looking for an internship or a freelance project. Do you want to contact me? Please send a email at oliveira.joao@unifesp.br or DM me at LinkedIn, I'll respond you as soon as possible.</p>
