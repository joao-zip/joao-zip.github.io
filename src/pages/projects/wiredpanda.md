So this is one of the most interesting projects that I work on, which is a university software created to help students learn about digital circuits, by letting them simulate and test the class examples and any circuit that the student want to. There is also a group that uses this software to teach digital circuits to high school students of public schools next to the campus.

Here, I learned a lot about writing real software, solving problems and bugs in the code with elegance, writing good commit messages and stablishing a minimal useful workflow, as well as writing new features and getting frustrated/improving with the complexity that arises from these ideas. The software was written with Qt and C++, which helps us to deploy it to Windows, MacOS and Linux as well.

Recently I recreated the project site using AstroJS and Bulma CSS, and it was awesome because I learned more about web dev and github actions. My next step is to make this site responsive, hope it'll be easy.
