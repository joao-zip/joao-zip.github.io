So this site itself is a project that I made, where I used Astro.js and GitHub Pages, learned a lot about how the web works, why I could use a framework to code in the web, and how to use components/layouts in general, and in particular in Astro, as well as I learned about CI/CD and GitHub Actions. Maybe the style is not the best, but I will improve it as I learn more about.
